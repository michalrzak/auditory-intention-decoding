example: "Your sole task in this experiment is to focus on a given target number while listening to sentences. These sentences will contain your target number along with other numbers. Multiple sentences will be presented for each random target, followed by a break.\n\nOccasionally, a sentence may not contain your target. When this happens, please press the 'spacebar'.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions now.\nIn the next section, you'll be guided through an example block of sentences. Please follow the on-screen instructions. You'll have another chance to ask questions afterward."
